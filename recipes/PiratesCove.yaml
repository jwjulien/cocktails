  I mistaken referred to this delicious fishbowl drink as a Superior Tide (another great cocktail from the Ambo) for
  years.  This is a favorite summertime sipper that's difficult to screw up, though Lani did once...  Admittedly I don't
  know the exact proportions, the numbers here are just kind of a best guess.

  They don't do any fancy prep with this one at the Ambo - they just build it right in the glass with way too much ice.
  I think that just fits with this style of drink.  Don't church it up, son!
