what: When validating a recipe, lookup (fuzzy string match) ingredients in other recipes that are similar sounding.
why: >-
  It's been very common for me to use slightly different names for the same ingredient across multiple recipes.

  It would be nice if I could get a warning to correct it at recipe creation time rather than when trying to use the
  ingredients or search commands and noticing a recipe is missing from the output.
how: Present the user with warning s suggesting they sound similar.
