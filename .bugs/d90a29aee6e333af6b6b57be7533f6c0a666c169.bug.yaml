what: Give ability to search for recipe that have a set of ingredients but may be
  missing 1 or 2.
why: |-
  I think this would be an excellent use of the tool to help find recipe:
  1. That could be made only with ingredients on hand (no missing items).
      - i.e. feed it everything you've got in the pantry and it'll tell you everything you could make.
  2. Some missing items.
      - Like maybe you're packing ingredients for a trip and you want to know what else you could make if you wanted to
        pack 1 or two more ingredients.
      - It would be particularly cool if this could offer suggestions of ingredients by the quantity of additional
        recipes that could be made.
how: '- Add `ingredients` option to the search function. - Add `missing` option to
  specify the integer number of missing ingredients to allow.'
