what: Now that I have a better understanding of ReportLab I really think it's a better fit for this application.
why: >-
  Namely because it'll allow use of vector graphics instead of raster graphics
  which will significantly increase quality.

  The change would also bring this tool in line with many others I have created recently that successfully make use
  of ReportLab.
