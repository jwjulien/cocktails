Cocktails
========================================================================================================================
After years of struggling to come up with the best forum for aggregating various drink recipes I have landed on this, JSON files.

My intent here is to capture the recipes needed to make various mixed drinks and cocktails that I enjoy, along with any notes that I have about the ingredients or the preparation, even though I don't really have, nor want to create a fully fledged tool to manage them.

A schema has been developed and is tied to the `ingredients` and `recipes` folders with VS Code workspace settings.  The `recipes` folder contains the various drink recipes while the `ingredients` folder contains recipes for some of the ingredients that need to be prepared for various drink recipes.

> **_DISCLAIMER:_**: The recipes presented here are (mostly) alcoholic.  The author assumes no responsibility for how you use this information.  Please drink responsibly.



Anti-Patterns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository does not contain "basic" drinks like "rum and coke" or "whisky neat".  If you can fully comprehend a recipe from the title alone, it really doesn't have a place here.




Future
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perhaps one day this repository might:

- Also contain a tool for generating fancy recipe cards.
- Contain a tool that can combine recipes to make packing/shopping lists.
- Certainly contain more drink recipes.
- At least a command line tool to assist with filtering recipes, e.g:
    - Filter by glass: "list all shots"
    - Filter by preparation: "blended drinks"
    - Grep with ingredients: "drinks with tequila"
    - etc.
